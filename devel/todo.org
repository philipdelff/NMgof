## 2019-04-09 philipdelff: doses should be added by x before plotting

## 2019-04-02 philipdelff: scale ranges. Fix within grp, sheet, or
## totally free.

## 2019-04-02 philipdelff: x and y scales should be controlled individually.

## 2019-04-02 philipdelff: Include possibility of limiting scale by
## pk, dose, and/or predictions

## This function performs two different operations. It plots profiles,
## and it splits the profiles by faceting and by splitting into a list
## of plots. At least the last part of splitting into a list should be
## split into a separate function.

## only plot available variables. Warn users what not found if verbose?

## there must be something easier than the format data stuff 

## structure the evid selection

## optionally colour all by id

## In yrange LLOQ should be taken into account if provided
